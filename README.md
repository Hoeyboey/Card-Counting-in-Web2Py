Hey there!

So, this was initially a project that would just work out the value of your hand in a 
game of Blackjack. Now it works out the percentage chance of you drawing a card that 
would bring you over 21. It's not done yet, as with every project on GitHub, but it
should be an interesting look into me as a developer. So, if you want to find the 
actual interesting stuff that isn't boilerplate nonsense, /modules/calculations.py 
was all written by me, as was the pages index.html, first.html, and second.html in 
/views/default. Finally, default.py in /controllers/ has some of my code in lines 11 
to 36.

Nothing too complicated, but hopefully interesting! /modules/calculations.py is 
almost certainly the bit you want to be looking at, as that's where most of the magic
happens. Slowly, this should get better?

Planned bits:
 - Page to put in other players' cards
 - Saving your hand if the deck isn't shuffled after each play
 - Hi/lo card counting system
 - Make it look less like the mess it is
 
This is all run through Web2Py, so, if something doesn't make sense, it's probably 
Web2Py's way of formatting things.
